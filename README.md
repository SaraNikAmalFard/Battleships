# Battleships

Hello and welcome to Battleships repository. <br/>
Here I have shared a simple 2 player battleships game in C++. <br/>
To compile and run the program you will need g++ or any IDE which can compile C++ like VS-Code. </br>
Please pay attention to the comments when entering players' names and directions. </br>
Should you have any questions about the project please feel free to contact me: sarah_nikamalfard@yahoo.com
